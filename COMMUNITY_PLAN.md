We want to show the world how easy it is to use the Tronix cryptocurrency and the Tron mainnet blockchain. One someone joins our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/CommunityNode) they will automatically receive a Tron wallet filled with 2 TRX and 1,000 CommunityNodeTokens which they can use to test the Tron blockchain with no risk.

We will create a How To demonstration for a simple dapp game that flips a coin and pays tokens when guessed correctly. Users can use this dapp as a basic API to a Tron smart contract to get started with the most powerful features of the Tron blockchain.

We have partnered with with the rest of the Tron Super Representatives to provide community support on a broader level than any of us is able to provide on our own. Together we are operating a [TRON Help Group](https://t.me/TronHelp) at Telegram to answer questions related to the Tron main net. 

In keeping with our open source ideology, we will also be pooling our collective knowledge and establishing best practices for the rest of the SR community, and we will publish that information in a fork of the Official Tron documentation.
