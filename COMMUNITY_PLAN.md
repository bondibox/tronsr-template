We want to show the world how easy it is to use the Tronix cryptocurrency and the Tron mainnet blockchain. Using the GoSeedit bot, when someone joins our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/CommunityNode) they will automatically receive a Tron wallet filled with 2 TRX and 1,000 CommunityNode tokens which they can use to test the Tron blockchain with no risk. This 'tchotchke' bot is available via the github repository.

We will also adapt this tchotcke bot to the Twitter API.

We are offering this service to fundraisers and campaigns to launch their own TRX10 based token which they can use in conjunction with their social media to help create excitement and interest in their projects.

We also operate the [TRON Help Group](https://t.me/TronHelp) at Telegram to answer questions related to the Tron main net.
