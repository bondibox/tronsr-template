We are using our Super Representative candidate allowance to give value to our CommunityNodeToken (TRUC). We have airdropped more than one million of these tokens to Tron voters and members of our telegram channel. We will continue to give the TRUC token value and to increase its circulating supply.

Once elected to Super Representative we will fund development projects specializing in ecommerce solutions.
