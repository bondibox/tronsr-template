We will be building our primary cluster instance at the Linode data center in Atlanta Georgia, USA., where they offer an OC768 incoming network connection, with 40 Gbps in and 10 Gbps out. We believe that the incoming network connection will be critical for the Super Representative nodes.

Because the Tron Virtual Machine acts like one big symmetric multiprocessor cluster, we do not need a one-size-fits-all server instance, instead we will be building several server instances each with a specific task.

A Super Representative faces two technical responsibilities. The mission critical component is running a well protected Witness Node. Then you must make available lots of flops and storage for TVM the Tron Virtual Machine.

Our Primary cluster will surround our Witness node with 6 Sentry nodes, which connect to the Witness via an IPSec tunnel. This cloaks the witness from the outside world, and allows it to advertise a private IP address. The 6 Sentry nodes act as the point of contact for the witness node, meaning a successful DDoS attack would have to discover and compromise all 6 Sentries. The Sentries will then be surrounded by unprotected Full Nodes which do the heavy lifting of the network. 8 of these nodes are configured to provide the most resources per dollar, and 4 are provisioned with 40/10 Gbps network connections for a total of more than 50 Gbps outbound bandwidth, since total bandwidth is the sum of all the nodes' guaranteed throughput.

Currently we are starting with the following setup:

1 Primary Witness Node 32 Cores  
1 Backup Witness Node 16 Cores  
1 Solidity Node 8 Cores  

For every .04Â¢ gain in TRX price we will add another 96 cores to our cluster.
