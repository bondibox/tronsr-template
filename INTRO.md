The Community Node organization began by being a technical leader in the Tron blockchain project, and we will remain at the forefront of server performance. A Tron Super Representative has many responsibilities, but let us not forget the #1 purpose - to run a high performance blockchain node.

We are the service oriented Super Representative group. We are here to assist the community with our [Tron Help Group](https://t.me/TronHelp), as well as other services offered.

Adoption of the Tronix protocol via DApps is a good way to engage TRX holders and increase transaction activity, but it might not be a sure way to bring on new users. We believe e-commerce is the path to adoption. Coming from a background of Ruby on Rails, our choice is to lead the development of a Ruby cryptocurrency payment gem for the Solidus e-commerce platform, putting into the public domain a no cost or low cost (<1%) payment solution.

We chose to make all of our projects Open Source in order to provide a blueprint for those who come after us. By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.

We have developed a Rewards Plan for the TRX voters who elect us to SR position. 

No more complicated formulas or percentages.

1 vote = 25 sun

10,000 votes = .25 TRX

Four times a day we will airdrop this reward to our voters.
