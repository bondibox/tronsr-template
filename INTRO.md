The Community Node organization is the service oriented Super Representative group. We are here to assist the community with our [Tron Help Group](https://t.me/TronHelp), as well as other services offered.

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. We expect other cryptocurrencies to use Tron's open source application as a starting point for their blockchain networks, as well as Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a blueprint for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices. 

Our initiatives are designed to bring new users into the Tron blockchain, as well as increase economic activity among current users.

We have developed a Rewards Plan for the TRX voters who elect us to SR position. 

No more complicated formulas or percentages.

1 vote = 50 sun

20,000 votes = 1 TRX

Four times a day we will airdrop this reward to our voters.

We will revise the payout number daily, as needed.
