The Community Node organization is an open source collaboration in the blockchain space. 

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. We expect other cryptocurrencies to use Tron's open source application as a starting point for their blockchain networks, as well as Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a blueprint for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.

We have developed a [Rewards Plan](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md) for the TRX voters who elect us to SR position. We will deposit 80% of block rewards into a *Payout Account*, this is called the *Daily Contribution*. 

Every day, we will draw the greater of 50% of the Daily Contribution or 2% of the Payout Account from the Payout Account for the *Daily Payout Pool*, which is divided per-vote. The actual reward per vote is adjusted slightly for every voter based on their participation rate, and adjusted daily when actual payouts exceed the Payout Pool.

In real terms, that means the payout pool will be about 40,000 every day we win, until we've got 2,000,000 TRX saved in the Rewards Account.
Then, the Daily Reward Pool will grow steadily until it reaches 4 million TRX then the amount going out will be equal to the amount going in.

When the Super Representative Program ends in 2012, we will use all of the expertise we've gained to continue to run the Tron network. When the program ends, we will spend the entire 4 million TRX that we've accrued in the Payout Account to buy hardware infrastructure on an enterprise level. If you'll excuse our optimism, we believe that will be worth considerably more than the $250,000 it is worth as of the date of this writing.
