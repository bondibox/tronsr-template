The Community Node organization is an open source collaboration in the blockchain space. 

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. We expect other cryptocurrencies to use Tron's open source application as a starting point for their blockchain networks, as well as Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a blueprint for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.

We have developed a [Rewards Plan](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md) for the TRX voters who elect us to SR position. 

We can create a stable, predictable voter payout by putting 80% of everything we earn into a *Payout Account* (a.k.a. the piggy bank), this is called the *Daily Contribution*. And every day we will pay our voters half of the Daily Contribution, or 2% of what's in the Payout Account, whichever is more. 

In real terms, that means the payout pool will start out at about 15,000 TRX every day we win. If we lose, the daily payout pool will be 2% of the Payout Account Total. When the Payout Account Total equals 650 Million TRX the Daily Payout will be the same whether we win or lose. At that point we will implement our participation bonus which gives a small increase per vote based on a voter's lifetime participation in voting for Community Node.

When the Payout Account has 1.3 million TRX in it, the Daily Payout Pool will be equal to the Daily Contribution and the Daily Payout will cap out at exactly 80% of node rewards, or about 30,000 TRX per day.

When the Super Representative Program ends in 2021, we will use all of the expertise we've gained to continue to run the Tron network. When the program ends, we will spend the entire 1.3 Million TRX that we've accrued in the Payout Account to buy hardware infrastructure on an enterprise level.

If this plan works as designed, we will have developed *both* the first rock solid cryptocurrency denominated investment with an advertised daily interest rate, **and** a hardware investment in the Tron network that is, at a minimum, equal to 1.3 Million TRX in 2021 dollars.
