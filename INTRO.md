The Community Node organization is an open source collaboration in the blockchain space. 

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. We expect other cryptocurrencies to use Tron's open source application as a starting point for their blockchain networks, as well as Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a blueprint for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.

We have developed a [Rewards Plan](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md) for the TRX voters who elect us to SR position. We will deposit 80% of block rewards into a *Rewards Account* from which we draw 2% per day for the *Daily Rewards Pool*, which is divided per-vote. The actual reward per vote is adjusted slightly for every voter based on their participation rate, and adjusted daily when actual payouts exceed the Reward Pool.
