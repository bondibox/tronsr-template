The Community Node SR group is a leader in Tron node operation, scripting, and blockchain development. We were the first Tron community member to run a block producing node, with [300 blocks produced](https://twitter.com/bondibox/status/989842934899101696) on the Tron TestNet in April, 2018.

We are available for hire as IT specialists and blockchain solution developers.

Find us on Tron's Discord server or our telegram chan where we'll answer questions about java machines or the APIs they provide.
