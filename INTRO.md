The Community Node organization is an open source collaboration in the blockchain space. 

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. We expect other cryptocurrencies to use Tron's open source application as a starting point for their blockchain networks, as well as Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a blueprint for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.

We have developed a [Rewards Plan](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md) for the TRX voters who elect us to SR position. We will deposit 80% of block rewards into a *Payout Account*, this is called the *Daily Contribution*. 

Every day, we will draw the greater of 50% of the Daily Contribution or 2% of the Payout Account from the Payout Account for the *Daily Payout Pool*, which is divided per-vote. The actual reward per vote is adjusted slightly for every voter based on their participation rate, and adjusted daily when actual payouts exceed the Payout Pool.

In real terms, that means the payout pool will be about 40,000 TRX every day we win. If we lose, the daily payout pool will be 2% of the Payout Account Total. When the Payout Account Total equals 2 Million TRX the Daily Payout will be the same whether we win or lose.

When the Payout Account has 4 million TRX in it, the Daily Payout Pool will be equal to the Daily Contribution and the Daily Payout will cap out at exactly 80% of node rewards, or about 80,000 TRX per day.

When the Super Representative Program ends in 2021, we will use all of the expertise we've gained to continue to run the Tron network. When the program ends, we will spend the entire 4 Million TRX that we've accrued in the Payout Account to buy hardware infrastructure on an enterprise level.
