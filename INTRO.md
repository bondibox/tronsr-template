The Community Node organization is an open source collaboration in the blockchain space. 

Our Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. The Tron project itself is open source, and we expect other cryptocurrencies to use the Tron application as a starting point for their blockchain networks. Other Distributed Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies may adopt Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours. We chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a resource for those who come after us.

By sharing our IT strategies, it is our hope to strengthen the entire blockchain industry and advance the determination of best practices.
