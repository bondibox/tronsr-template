**`â€¢ Budget Expenditure and Technical Plan`**  

The Tron Super Representative program has two income distributions to Registered Super Representatives. 
 
The Tron Super Representative Candidate Allowance is currently 16 trx per block.   All Super Representative candidates in the top 127 will receive a portion of this allowance based on their share of the total votes cast.   

The currently elected 27 Super Representatives are the top 27 Super Representative candidates. They each take turns producing blocks every 3 seconds. For every block produced Tron Foundation rewards the block producer 32 TRX. Each Super Representative produces one block once every 81 seconds. With no dropped blocks that is 34133 TRX per 24 hour cycle.

Community Node will inject all of our candidate allowance into the TRX market capitalization of our CommunityNodeToken DEX exchange.

Community Node will direct all of our block rewards toward operating expenses including running nodes, developing dapps, and supporting projects that bring value to the Tron ecosystem.
