Percentages are of daily block rewards earned.  
80% - Voter Rewards Program  
7% - Resource Deployments
13% - Operating Expenses

We will distribute up to 80% of daily block rewards back to the voters who elect us to office, through a program that draws payouts from a slowly accruing payout account which maxxes out at 1.3 Million TRX. When the Super Representative Program ends in 2021, we will use all of the expertise we've gained to continue to run the Tron network. We will spend the entire 1.3 Million TRX that we've accrued in the payout account to buy hardware infrastructure on an enterprise level.
